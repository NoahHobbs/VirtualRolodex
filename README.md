Making a way to store contacts and view them using a database and GUI in QT creator
I worked on Jason Hobbs' laptop for most of the project because QT Creator does not run on mine.
The GUI hopefully is simple to follow but for some user tips:
Don't worry about formatting the name, email or phone as it is done automatically by the program.
When you check a specific contact you search them by name and it should be their full name.
The all contacts text box is scrollable if you do not see the person you're looking for.
